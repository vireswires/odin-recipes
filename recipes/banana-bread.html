        <h2>How Kalin Makes It</h2>
        <p>Kalin is really awesome at making banana bread. Here's how he does it.
            First melt the butter. Preheat the oven while melting the butter. Next mash up 3 large 
            bananas. Pour the melted butter into the bananas, stir, and then add the egg. Then add the
            baking soda, salt, and sugar. Finally add vanilla, and last the flour. If you want you can 
            also add chopped <strong>walnuts</strong> here. <em>yum!</em>
        </p>
        <p>Pour it into a baking dish, and put it in the preheated oven, set your timer for 45 min, and make
            sure to check it at that point! If it's too mushy inside, let it go another few minutes, but remember 
            it will continue to cook very slightly after you take it out of the oven.
            <em>Better a little soft than too dry!</em>
        </p>
