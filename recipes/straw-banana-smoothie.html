        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe needs no descriptons. Everyone knows what a smoothie is. But In case
            you don't, you put the ingredients in a blender with some ice. Then you drink it and 
            get ice cream headache.
        </p>
        <p>Make sure you don't wait too long to drink it or it'll get warm. Then it's kinda
            gross and at least 2x worse than when it's cold. Some people put ice cubes in if it's
            taking them too long to drink it, but I say that's a <strong>bad idea.</strong>
